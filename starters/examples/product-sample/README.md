# Product Example

Here you can find some files useful to test the Gemini Starters:

- *product_schema.yaml* is the Gemini Schema 
- *restconfig.yaml* contains a REST configuration
- *insertRandomProdut.js* can be useful to insert some records

To use them please take a look at the README of the Gemini starter you are testing.
